# Introdução e Etapas

The general objective of the thesis is to study, for regime-switching (RS) models, their ability to correctly identify regimes in different data-generating processes, using Monte Carlo simulations.

**Step 1:** Define the regime-generating processes (RGP) to be considered.

- The initial list includes Markov Switching, Thresholds (and self-exciting thresholds), Structural Breaks, Clustering (unsupervised), smooth transition, and models based on random forests.
- For each RGP, it will be necessary to define some hyperparameters, the most important being the number of regimes. Initially, cases with 2 and 3 regimes will be studied.

**Step 2:** Define the data-generating processes (DGP) to be considered.

- The initial focus will be on univariate or multivariate autoregressive models (AR or VAR). The combination of RGP + DGP will result in the final model, such as MS-AR and MS-VAR. Other models, such as ARMA/VARMA and models with endogenous volatility, may also be considered. To simplify, the study may focus on just one DGP (e.g., AR).
- For each DGP, it will be necessary to define parameters such as the number of lags, variables, observations, and coefficients (stationarity, high or low persistence, relationship between variables). I will conduct an informal analysis of the relevance of each and focus more on what is important.

**Step 3:** Define the simulation algorithm. In general terms:

\begin{algorithm}
    \caption{Regime Model Simulation}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \For{$sim = 1$ \textbf{to} $n_{sims}$}
            \For{\textbf{each} $dgp$ \textbf{in} $dgps$}
                \For{\textbf{each} $rgp$ \textbf{in} $rgps$}
                    \For{\textbf{each} $mod$ \textbf{in} $models$} 
                        \State Generate $n_{obs}$ data according to $rgp$ + $dgp$
                        \State Estimate $mod$ on the $1:n_{train}$ portion of the generated data
                        \State Save the data, model results, and forecast for $(n_{train} + 1):n_{obs}$
                        \EndFor
                \EndFor
            \EndFor
        \EndFor
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

**Step 4:** Study the regime identification performance and define descriptive metrics for the analysis.

- For each $dgp$, assess how each model $mod$ identifies the regimes generated by each $rgp$.
- Compare the estimated regime indicator variable with the true one.
- An innovative aspect of the work will be to define metrics that describe the _nature_ of the generated regimes, to better understand the differences between models.

**Step 5:** Study the forecasting performance of the models.

- Assess how each model $mod$ forecasts the regimes and data generated by each $rgp$.
- Try to establish a relationship between regime identification performance and forecasting performance. Which characteristics of the regimes "need to be captured" to be associated with good forecasting, and which are not relevant?
- Is there evidence for a universal approximator? That is, is there a model that performs well in all cases?
- Prescribe a standard table of descriptive statistics to be included in regime-switching studies, to add quality to the analysis of results. Additionally, create an R package for generating these tables.

**Step 6:** Apply the empirically acquired knowledge.

- Define a variable of interest, initially in the area of sentiment or uncertainty indices.
- Seek institutional and empirical information about the regime-switching context related to this variable.
- Estimate different RS models and compare the results based on the knowledge obtained. The idea of a universal approximator will be especially relevant.

**Other:**

- Conduct a literature review to motivate the work and build a technical knowledge base on the functioning and performance of each model. This will help identify gaps and formulate hypotheses.
- Conclude the work with a final analysis.
- Create 100% reproducible code and make it available [on my GitHub](https://github.com/ricardo-semiao/article-regime-id-performance).



# Regime Comparison Metrics

I will study a broad set of descriptive metrics to identify the most relevant ones for regime comparison. Some initial ideas:

**Basic statistics:**

- Moments of the variable(s) of interest:
    - Mean, variance, covariance, etc.
    - ACF, PACF, CCF.
- Average duration.
- Fit quality: R^2, MSE, information criteria.
- Granger causality strength.
- Model-specific metrics: transition probabilities.

**Theme-specific:**

- Relationship with institutional regimes:
    - Fiscal or monetary dominance, growth or recession, etc.
    - Correlation (or more generally) with variables of interest.

**Specific statistics:**

- Metrics based on observations in each regime:
    - Centroid distances: Davies–Bouldin index, silhouette.
    - Distribution distances of variables: Earth mover's distance.
- Variable relevance in each regime: PCA weights, % of explained variance, etc.
- Metrics based on parameters of each regime:
    - Parameter difference tests.
    - Comparison of ACFs and IRFs implied by the parameters.
        - $\Delta^{r_2}_{r_1} P = \Phi^{r_1} - \Phi^{r_2}$, possibly calculated row/column by row/column.
        - $\Delta^{r_2}_{r_1} \rho_{i}(l; \Phi^{r})$, alternative accumulated: $\sum_{l = 1}^H \Delta^{r_2}_{r_1} \rho_{i}(l; \Phi^{r})$.
        - $\Delta^{r_2}_{r_1} IRF_{ij}(h; \Phi^{r})$, accumulated, discounted, alternative: $\sum_{h = 1}^H \beta^h \Delta^{r_2}_{r_1} IRF_{ij}(h; \Phi^{r})$.
