## Introdução

[Contextualization] Regime switching (RS) models are/have been used to [...]. As with any forecasting model, it is important to understand what are the factors that influence their performance.

[What's been done and what's missing] Papers such as [...] have studied the performance of RS models in different economic contexts, but I argue that little attention has been given to the relation between the characteristics of the regimes and the forecasting performance of the models.

[Why what's missing is important] Understanding the role of regime identification is important as it could supply researchers with tools to better understand the expected performance of their models, by analyzing the characteristics of the estimated regimes. Additionally, this exercise also brings further information on the differences between the RS models, and in which type of regime natures each performs better.

[What ill do] In this work, I will study the relationship between performance and regime identification capabilities, via Monte Carlo simulations. Regime identification relates to the difference in characteristics of true and estimated regimes, in the terms of a predefined set of metrics. The simulations will be run for several RS models, on different regime-generating and conditional-on-regime serie-generating processes.

[Literature review] To set the stage for the simulations, a revision on the statistical characteristics and stylized empirical facts of the RS models is provided, as well as a revision on the regime metrics used on the literature. I also discuss the previously done performance studies, and what they inform about the role of regime identification.
